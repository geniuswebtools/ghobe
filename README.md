==========================

The purpose of this file is to make a valid attempt to stop brute force login
attacks against your WordPress installation.

If you have not yet installed the WordFence plugin by Mark Maunder, you should
do that as well:

The WordFence plugin will provide you with much better protection, and it will
tell you the `brutes` trying to hack their way in to your WordPress setup.
